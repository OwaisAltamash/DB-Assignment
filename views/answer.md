Question 1:- Explain the relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities from the above diagram?

Ans:- the relationship between "Product" and "Product_Category" remains a one-to-many relationship.
One-to-Many Relationship: Each product in the "Product" table can belong to only one category from the "Product_Category" table.

In terms of database design:

Foreign Key Constraint: The "Product" table typically contains a foreign key column, often named something like "category_id", which references the primary key column of the "Product_Category" table. This foreign key establishes the relationship between the two tables.

Example: For instance, a product with a "category_id" value of 1 in the "Product" table indicates that this product belongs to the category with a primary key value of 1 in the "Product_Category" table. This enables you to organize products into specific categories.

Question 2:- How could you ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it?

Ans:- you can ensure that each product in the "Product" collection has a valid category assigned to it by enforcing data integrity rules in your application code.

1. Pre-Validation: Before inserting or updating a product document in the "Product" collection, verify that the category assigned to the product exists in the "Product_Category" collection.

2. Query for Category Existence: Before saving a product, perform a query to check if the category ID assigned to the product exists in the "Product_Category" collection.

3. Error Handling: If the category does not exist, handle the error appropriately. You can choose to reject the operation, assign a default category, or handle it based on your application's requirements.


const mongoose = require('mongoose');
const { Product, Product_Category } = require('./models');

// Function to create a new product
async function createProduct(name, description, categoryId) {
    // Check if the category exists
    const categoryExists = await Product_Category.exists({ _id: categoryId });
    
    if (!categoryExists) {
        throw new Error('Invalid category ID');
    }

    // Create the product
    const product = new Product({
        name,
        description,
        category: categoryId
    });

    // Save the product
    await product.save();

    return product;
}

// Usage example:-
createProduct('Sample Product', 'This is a sample product', 'category_id_here')
    .then(product => console.log('Product created:', product))
    .catch(error => console.error('Error creating product:', error));


example:-

.We have a function createProduct that creates a new product.
.Before creating the product, we check if the category exists using Product_Category.exists.
.If the category does not exist, we throw an error indicating an invalid category ID.
.Otherwise, we create the product and save it to the database.

By performing this check before saving the product, you ensure that each product has a valid category assigned.
